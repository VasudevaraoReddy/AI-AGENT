Vulnerable AWS EC2 Instance**: The instance 'my-ec2-instance' is running with an outdated kernel, making it vulnerable to attacks.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-ec2-instance\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Update the kernel to the latest version.\n\t+ **2. Unsecured RDS Database**: The RDS database 'my-rds-db' has a public endpoint and no VPC security group, making it accessible from the internet.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-rds-db\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Create a VPC security group to restrict access.\n\n* **Performance (Medium):**\n\t+ **3. Overprovisioned EBS Volume**: The EBS volume 'my-ebs-volume' has a larger size than required, leading to unnecessary costs.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-ebs-volume\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Resize the volume to the minimum required size.\n\n* **Performance (Low):**\n\t+ **4. Unused Lambda Function**: The Lambda function 'my-lambda-function' is no longer in use and can be removed.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-lambda-function\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Remove the unused function.\n\t+ **5. Unoptimized S3 Bucket Configuration**: The S3 bucket 'my-s3-bucket' has a publicly accessible configuration, leading to potential performance issues.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-s3-bucket\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Reconfigure the bucket with private access.\n\n* **Cost (Medium):**\n\t+ **6. Underutilized EC2 Instance**: The EC2 instance 'my-underutilized-instance' is underutilized and can be downsized.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-underutilized-instance\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Downsize the instance to a smaller size.\n\n* **Security (Medium):**\n\t+ **7. Missing IAM Role**: The IAM role 'my-missing-role' is not attached to any resources, making it unnecessary.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-missing-role\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Remove the unnecessary role.\n\t+ **8. Unsecured SQS Queue**: The SQS queue 'my-sqs-queue' has a public endpoint and no VPC security group, making it accessible from the internet.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-sqs-queue\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Create a VPC security group to restrict access.\n\n* **Performance (High):**\n\t+ **9. High Latency RDS Database**: The RDS database 'my-rds-db' has high latency due to inadequate configuration.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-rds-db\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Reconfigure the database for optimal performance.\n\n* **Security (Low):**\n\t+ **10. Unsecured CloudWatch Log Group**: The CloudWatch log group 'my-cloudwatch-log-group' has a public endpoint and no VPC security group, making it accessible from the internet.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-cloudwatch-log-group\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Create a VPC security group to restrict access.\n\n* **Performance (Medium):**\n\t+ **11. High CPU Utilization EC2 Instance**: The EC2 instance 'my-high-cpu-instance' has high CPU utilization due to inadequate configuration.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-high-cpu-instance\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Reconfigure the instance for optimal performance.\n\n* **Security (Medium):**\n\t+ **12. Missing VPC Endpoint**: The VPC endpoint 'my-missing-vpc-endpoint' is not configured, making it necessary to create one.\n\t\t- Affected Resource: my-missing-vpc-endpoint\n\t\t- Suggested Solution: Create the missing VPC endpoint.\n\nNote: This summary is based on a hypothetical scan result and may not reflect real-world scenarios.",
